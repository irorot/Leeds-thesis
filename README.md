## Description of goal

(via email from Iroro)

I need to write a function to subset observations from a data frame based on two conditions on two vectors. The first condition is computing iterative differences of one vector (time) if they fall within the same unique values of another vector (time period). The second condition is to subset observations (i.e. row values from all other vectors) within the data frame for which the value of the time vector is < 3 secs.

I have attempted to write a function for the first condition but its not giving the desired result.
